Feature: Product Management
  As a store owner
  I want to update product information
  So that customers can view accurate details

  Scenario: Update an existing product
    Given there is an existing product with ID "123" and name "Old Product" and price "50"
    When I update the product information with ID "123" and name "New Product" and price "60"
    Then the product information should be updated successfully
    And I should be able to view the updated product details with ID "123" and name "New Product" and price "60"
